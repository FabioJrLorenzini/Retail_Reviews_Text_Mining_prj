# Retail_Reviews_Text_Mining_prj

## Retail Reviews Text Mining, Iper Brembate & Competitors
The project focused on enhancing the customer experience at an Italian hypermarket, specifically the 'Iper' branch in Brembate (Bergamo). 
Employing advanced text mining techniques, the goal was to identify critical aspects and recommend areas for improvement. 

Key activities included:
• Scraping and analyzing reviews from Google Maps for Iper and six main competitors in the same geographical region.
• Pre-processing data, applying sentiment analysis and hierarchical clustering techniques using the "Orange" data mining tool for each store.
• Uncovering pros and cons through sentiment analysis and establishing a ranking of hypermarkets based on both sentiment algorithm results and average customer scores.
• Presenting critical points and delivering data-driven insights to Iper's executives, accompanied by actionable suggestions to enhance the overall customer experience.
